fix: restore open virtual positions on startup for EOD liquidation

- Add _restore_open_virtual_positions() to system initialization
- Loads unclosed BUY records from DB and sets them as POSITIONED
- Ensures 15:00 EOD liquidation covers positions from previous days
- Also bulk-closed 133 stale positions (Jan 27 - Feb 19) in DB

Previously, program restart cleared memory so old positions were
never eligible for EOD liquidation, accumulating indefinitely.
